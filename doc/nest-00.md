# Getting started with Nest

## Introduction

Nest is Raven's Package Manager, and is dependency-based. Raven is an adaptive, customizable and evolutive open-source Operating System based on the Linux kernel. If you're not familiar with it, you can find more information about it [here](https://raven-os.org).

An important thing to keep in mind, is that you should not use Nest in an unprotected environment, as Nest assumes there's no other package manager installed on your current system.
